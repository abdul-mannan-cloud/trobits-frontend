                Tabi was a crypto skeptic who became a believer in 2021. He
                ventured into the crypto world through bot trading. He began to
                read avidly on block chain technology and cryptocurrencies.
                Unfortunately, in November 2021, Bitcoin hit the All-Time-High
                and the crypto winter began. He bought the dip expecting a quick
                turnaround. This didn t come. His positions were in the Red. He
                invested even more, into many cryptocurrencies especially LUNA
                and SHIB. He invested heavily in the Anchor Protocol. Then came
                the famous crash of May 2022 and his fortunes were wiped.
                However, like all the Lunatics out there, he believes in the
                revival of the now LUNA Classic (LUNC). Together with his
                friends, they have been exploring creative ways to aid that
                revival process and get LUNC back to its glory days.
